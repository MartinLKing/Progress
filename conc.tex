\section{Conclusion}

When looking at the history of actual progress, we found that monistic conceptions miss out on \textit{local} improvements.
Also, due to the fact that existing measures of progress are concerned with \textit{global} comparisons of theory, they ignore the significant progress stemming from operational improvements that underlie and enable most of the progress in knowledge, understanding, and problem-solving. 
Gaining the ability to process more data or to better control a particle beam with improved magnets, etc. already constitutes progress whether or not it leads to further theoretical improvements.
